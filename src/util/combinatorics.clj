(combinations items n) - A lazy sequence of all the unique
ways of taking n different elements from items.
Example: (combinations [1 2 3] 2) -> ((1 2) (1 3) (2 3))

(subsets items) - A lazy sequence of all the subsets of
items (but generalized to all sequences, not just sets).
Example: (subsets [1 2 3]) -> (() (1) (2) (3) (1 2) (1 3) (2 3) (1 2 3))

(cartesian-product & seqs) - Takes any number of sequences
as arguments, and returns a lazy sequence of all the ways
to take one item from each seq.
Example: (cartesian-product [1 2] [3 4]) -> ((1 3) (1 4) (2 3) (2 4))
(cartesian-product seq1 seq2 seq3 ...) behaves like but is
faster than a nested for loop, such as:
(for [i1 seq1 i2 seq2 i3 seq3 ...] (list i1 i2 i3 ...))

(selections items n) - A lazy sequence of all the ways to
take n (possibly the same) items from the sequence of items.
Example: (selections [1 2] 3) -> ((1 1 1) (1 1 2) (1 2 1) (1 2 2) (2 1 1) (2 1 2) (2 2 1) (2 2 2))

(permutations items) - A lazy sequence of all the permutations
of items.
Example: (permutations [1 2 3]) -> ((1 2 3) (1 3 2) (2 1 3) (2 3 1) (3 1 2) (3 2 1))
Example: (permutations [1 1 2]) -> ((1 1 2) (1 2 1) (2 1 1))

About this code:
These combinatorial functions can be written in an elegant way using recursion.  However, when dealing with combinations and permutations, you're usually generating large numbers of things, and speed counts.  My objective was to write the fastest possible code I could, restricting myself to Clojure's functional, persistent data structures (rather than using Java's arrays) so that this code could be safely leveraged within Clojure's transactional concurrency system.

I also restricted myself to algorithms that return results in a standard order.  For example, there are faster ways to generate cartesian-product, but I don't know of a faster way to generate the results in the standard nested-for-loop order.

Most of these algorithms are derived from algorithms found in Knuth's wonderful Art of Computer Programming books (specifically, the volume 4 fascicles), which present fast, iterative solutions to these common combinatorial problems.  Unfortunately, these iterative versions are somewhat inscrutable.  If you want to better understand these algorithms, the Knuth books are the place to start.
