;; EULER #370
;; ==========
;; Let us define a geometric triangle as an integer sided triangle with
;; sides a <= b <= c so that its sides form a geometric progression, i.e. 
;; b^2 = a Â· c . 
;;
;; An example of such a geometric triangle is the triangle with sides
;; a = 144, b = 156 and c = 169.
;; 
;; There are 861805 geometric triangles with perimeter <= 10^6 .
;;
;; How many geometric triangles exist with perimeter <= 2.5x10^13 ?)
