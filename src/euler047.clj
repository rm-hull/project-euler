;; ==========
;; The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime 
;; factors are:
;; 
;;    14 = 2 x 7
;;    15 = 3 x 5
;;
;; The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct 
;; prime factors are:
;;
;;    644 = 2Â² x 7 x 23
;;    645 = 3 x 5 x 43
;;    646 = 2 x 17 x 19.
;;
;; Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct 
;; primes factors. What is the first of these numbers?
